# How Can Canada Contribute to More Sustainable E-Waste Management Globally?

This is the typeset version of an original research report I did during my studies in the
Sustainability Perspectives graduate microprogram at Concordia University.

This is original research produced by &copy; Matthew Segal 2024.

I studied electronic waste (e-waste) from a global and Canadian perspective: what it is;
how it's created; where it goes; and the health, environmental, and equity challenges inherent
to it's recycling.

I also introduced a new model for recycling based on the existing 3R model (reduce, reuse, recycle), that considers these three activities in proper proportion.

As an added analysis, I also studied e-waste from a local perspective by analyzing the e-waste
habits of Montrealers when faced with the choice of what to do with their electronic devices.

The original code used in this report is found in another one of my repositories:
