  abstract = {Electronic waste (e-waste) is a rapidly developing environmental problem particularly for the most developed countries. There are technological solutions for processing it, but these are costly, and the cheaper option for most developed countries has been to export most of the waste to less developed countries. There are various laws and policies for regulating the processing of e-waste at different governance scales such as the international Basel Convention, the regional Bamoko Convention, and various national laws. However, many of the regulations are not fully implemented and there is substantial financial pressure to maintain the jobs created for processing e-waste. Mexico, Brazil, Ghana Nigeria, India, and China have been selected for a more detailed study of the transboundary movements of e-waste. This includes a systematic review of existing literature, the application of the Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response (DPSIR) framework for analysing complex problems associated with social ecological systems, and the application of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for evaluating the environmental impact of electronic devices from their manufacture through to their final disposal. Japan, Italy, Switzerland, and Norway have been selected for the LCA to show how e-waste is diverted to developing countries, as there is not sufficient data available for the assessment from the selected developing countries. GOOD, BAD and UGLY outcomes have been identified from this study: the GOOD is the creation of jobs and the use of e-waste as a source of raw materials; the BAD is the exacerbation of the already poor environmental conditions in developing countries; the UGLY is the negative impact on the health of workers processing e-waste due to a wide range of toxic components in this waste. There are a number of management options that are available to reduce the impact of the BAD and the UGLY, such as adopting the concept of a circular economy, urban mining, reducing loopholes and improving existing policies and regulations, as well as reducing the disparity in income between the top and bottom of the management hierarchy for e-waste disposal. The overarching message is a request for developed countries to help developing countries in the fight against e-waste, rather than exporting their environmental problems to these poorer regions.},

  abstract = {The study investigated why sustainable technologies are not used to collect, dismantle and sell e-waste at Agbogbloshie given the risk of injury and extensive environmental pollution associated with handling of electronic waste. The study objectives were to examine the nature of technologies adopted to manage e-waste, assess challenges faced in adopting sustainable technologies; determine the missing links between formal and informal e-waste workers. Research questions were; what is the current level of technology adopted to manage e-waste and challenges limiting the adoption of sustainable technologies; and what are the missing links between the formal and informal sectors that limit adoption of sustainable e-waste management strategies. Data collection involved use of questionnaire to gather data on technologies used for e-waste management, challenges faced in using such technologies and what the workers consider as solutions to sustainable e-waste management. Field observations helped to explain waste management operations and questionnaire responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Study results show most of the e-waste workers are youthful and not much educated. The use of unsustainable technologies to manage e-waste has contributed to physical injuries to workers and pollution of the environment. A major challenge limiting the use of sustainable technologies is lack of financial resources to acquire modern equipment despite the laborious nature of the work. The paper concludes that sustainable solutions to electronic waste management requires support from government to subsidize the cost of sustainable technologies in e-waste management.},

We show that IPR offers superior DfR incentives as compared to CPR, and provides a level competitive ground. CPR may distort competition and allow free‐riding on DfR efforts to reduce product recovery costs. Thus, manufacturer preferences for IPR or CPR may differ because of the free‐riding implications under CPR, with even high‐end manufacturers having incentives to free‐ride under certain competitive conditions. The policy choice between IPR and CPR is not clear cut from an economic welfare perspective. This choice involves a comparison between the effects of superior recovery cost reduction through improved DfR under IPR and the operational cost‐efficiency under CPR.},

This research article reveals the presence of a strong linear correlation among global e-waste generation and Gross Domestic Product. The obtained results indicate that the best fit for data can be reached by comparing e-waste collected volumes and GDP PPS. More in detail, an increase of 1000 GDP PPS means an additional 0.27kg of e-waste collected and 0.22kg of e-waste reused/recycled. Furthermore, for each additional citizen, there will be an increase of 7.7kg of e-waste collected and 6.2kg of e-waste reused/recycled. The better collection of e-waste acts an important role concerning the circular economy, and it can be an advantageous approach. Therefore, e-waste could be considered as an opportunity for recycling or recovery of valuable metals (e.g., copper, gold, silver, and palladium), given their significant content in precious metals than in mineral ores.},

  abstract = {Producers of low volume, long life products must utilize the latest commercial, off the shelf (COTS) components in order to meet cutting edge technological needs. These COTS components often have a primary use in the high volume commercial markets (e.g. smart phones) which are characterized by short product lifecycles to satisfy consumer needs and remain competitive. Consequently, the two to three year lifecycles of these products tend to heavily influence the lifecycle of the components inside. Most tactical military products (as an example of low volume, long life products) have a very long design, production and support period that can often exceed ten years. Given the lifecycle mismatch between the products and components, an obsolescence management process is essential in order for a producer of low volume, long life products to effectively manage obsolescence in their product line. In this paper, the obsolescence management strategies are reviewed to identify best practices and recommendations that can improve a company's ability to deal with obsolescence, sometimes called DMSMS (Diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages), though the terms are not strictly interchangeable. This is achieved not only through a comprehensive literature review but also through a series of case studies from different companies. These validate findings from literature and provide a realistic perspective on the challenge to manage obsolescence, during the product development lifecycle.},

  abstract = {Background E-waste includes electrical and electronic equipment discarded as waste without intent of reuse. Informal e-waste recycling, typically done in smaller, unorganized businesses, can expose workers and communities to serious chemical health hazards. It is unclear if formalization into larger, better-controlled electronics recycling (e-recycling) facilities solves environmental and occupational health problems. Objectives To systematically review the literature on occupational and environmental health hazards of formal e-recycling facilities and discuss challenges and opportunities to strengthen research in this area. Methods We identified 37 publications from 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Environmental Index, NIOSHTIC-2) specific to chemical exposures in formal e-recycling facilities. Discussion Environmental and occupational exposures depend on the degree of formalization of the facilities but further reduction is needed. Reported worker exposures to metals were often higher than recommended occupational guidelines. Levels of brominated flame-retardants in worker's inhaled air and biological samples were higher than those from reference groups. Air, dust, and soil concentrations of metals, brominated flame-retardants, dioxins, furans, polycyclic-aromatic hydrocarbons, or polychlorinated biphenyls found inside or near the facilities were generally higher than reference locations, suggesting transport into the environment. Children of a recycler had blood lead levels higher than public health recommended guidelines. Conclusions With mounting e-waste, more workers, their family members, and communities could experience unhealthful exposures to metals and other chemicals. We identified research needs to further assess exposures, health, and improve controls. The long-term solution is manufacturing of electronics without harmful substances and easy-to-disassemble components.},

  abstract = {Purpose This article explores the protective measures and the occupational health and safety (OHS) prevention strategies in place in the formal electronic equipment recycling (e-recycling) industry, more specifically in the Greater Montreal area (Quebec, Canada) and their consequences: health inequalities and level of compliance with environmental standards. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using two respondent-specific questionnaires, one for workers and one for supervisors. Data collection and analytic procedures drew from qualitative content analysis. It was tempted to identify differences in OHS practices in relation to the workers' employment status and to link the companies' OHS concerns to their level of compliance with environmental standards. The article highlights specific OHS issues in the formal e-recycling industry. Enforcing compliance with environmental standards as a lever for promoting OHS appears to be a promising strategy. Another main finding was the workforce diversity and related OHS vulnerabilities in this industry and the challenges they pose to employers' ability to adequately and equally reach and protect all workers involved. To date, too little attention appears to have been paid to working conditions and worker protection in this rapidly growing sector. Specific prevention programmes could be implemented and adapted to the industry's diverse workforce and its multiple OHS vulnerabilities. This issue calls for the international community to take responsibility, as many electronic waste (e-waste) generated worldwide is shipped to developing countries, where lack of regulation and control is much more striking in a sector that remains very largely informal.},

Given that EU is trying, since the last two decades, to develop a circular economy based on the exploitation of resources recovered by wastes, a comprehensive framework supporting the decision-making process of multi-WEEE recycling centres will be analysed in this paper. An economic assessment will define the potential revenues coming from the recovery of 14 e-products (e.g. LCD notebooks, LED notebooks, CRT TVs, LCD TVs, LED TVs, CRT monitors, LCD monitors, LED monitors, cell phones, smart phones, PV panels, HDDs, SSDs and tablets) on the base of current and future disposed volumes in Europe. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis will be used to test the impact of some critical variables (e.g. price of recovered materials, input materials composition, degree of purity obtained by the recycling process, volumes generated, and percentage of collected waste) on specific economic indexes. A discussion of the economic assessment results shows the main challenges in the recycling sector and streamlines some concrete solutions.},

Weak e-waste regulations and limited use of safety measures for e-waste workers in Accra, Ghana, foster an exploitative environment within the industry, and pose health risks for those working and living near e-waste processing sites. This paper presents an integrated review of over 40 e-waste studies specific to Accra, with particular emphasis on the well-studied e-waste processing site in Agbogbloshie, and synthesizes the existing research base across interdisciplinary themes of human health, environmental health, globalization, trade and informalization, and public policy. Despite significant international attention to Accra's e-waste problem, loopholes within international environmental regulations and treaties provide few incentives and resources for Ghana to strengthen protections for human and environmental health. After a decade of e-waste research in Accra, the crisis continues to intensify; we present a renewed vision for sustainable e-waste policy reform in Ghana and beyond.},

Our approach contributes to the critique and recovery of community representation in participatory development and the search for ways to facilitate representative community engagement. Specifically, we describe our use of a novel Delphi-like method that allowed us to facilitate a broadly endorsed development trajectory within a heterogeneous and conflicted community. We show how the results yielded by this approach diverged from those that were likely to emerge from more facile forms of participation in ways that are important for other similar e-waste hubs internationally, which face a destructive status quo on the one hand, or the economically ruinous international policies that ban e-waste trade from “developed” to “developing” countries on the other. Despite real tensions and cleavages within the affected communities, the process described facilitated a shift from deadlocked environmental versus livelihood positions towards building capacity and regulating existing informal e-waste trades to preserve livelihoods dependent on these.},

  abstract = {Twenty-nine air samples of total suspended particles (TSP, particles less than 30-60μm) and thirty samples of particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5μm (PM2.5) were collected at Guiyu, an electronic waste (e-waste) recycling site in southeast China from 16 August 2004 to 17 September 2004. The results showed that mass concentrations contained in TSP and PM2.5 were 124±44.1 and 62.12±20.5μgm-3, respectively. The total sum of 16 USEPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with TSP and PM2.5 ranged from 40.0 to 347 and 22.7 to 263ngm-3, respectively. Five-ring and six-ring PAHs accounted for 73\% of total PAHs. The average concentration of benzo(a) pyrene was 2-6 times higher than in other Asian cities. Concentrations of Cr, Cu and Zn in PM2.5 of Guiyu were 4-33 times higher than in other Asian countries. In general, there were significant correlations between concentrations of individual contaminants in TSP with PM2.5 (i.e. PAHs, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn except Ni and As). The high concentrations of both PAHs and heavy metals in air of Guiyu may impose a serious environmental and health concern. Cytotoxicity of the extract of TSP and PM2.5 of ten 24h samples collected against human promonocytic leukemia cell line U937 (ATCC 1593.2) was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay. The results showed that under the same concentrations of extract, PM2.5 cytotoxicity was 2-4 times higher than TSP.},

  abstract = {Perchlorate (ClO4-) and thiocyanate (SCN-)~interfere with iodide (I-) uptake by the sodium/iodide symporter, and thereby these anions may affect the production of thyroid hormones (THs) in the thyroid gland. Although human exposure to perchlorate and thiocyanate has been studied in the United States and Europe, few investigations have been performed in Asian countries. In this study, we determined concentrations of perchlorate, thiocyanate, and iodide in 131 serum samples collected from 2 locations in Northern Vietnam, Bui Dau (BD; electrical and electronic waste [e-waste] recycling site) and Doung Quang (DQ; rural site) and examined the association between serum levels of these anions with levels of THs. The median concentrations of perchlorate, thiocyanate, and iodide detected in the serum of Vietnamese subjects were 0.104, 2020, and 3.11~ng~mL-1, respectively. Perchlorate levels were significantly greater in serum of the BD population (median 0.116~ng~mL-1) than those in the DQ population (median 0.086~ng~mL-1), which indicated greater exposure from e-waste recycling operations by the former. Serum concentrations of thiocyanate were not significantly different between the BD and DQ populations, but increased levels of this anion were observed among smokers. Iodide was a significant positive predictor of serum levels of FT3 and TT3 and a significant negative predictor of thyroid-stimulating hormone in males. When the association between serum levels of perchlorate or thiocyanate and THs was assessed using a stepwise multiple linear regression model, no significant correlations were found. In addition to greater concentrations of perchlorate detected in the e-waste recycling population, however, given that lower concentrations of iodide were observed in the serum of Vietnamese females, detailed risk assessments on TH homeostasis for females inhabiting e-waste recycling sites, especially for pregnant women and their neonates, are required.},

  abstract = {Currently, only a few countries have a uniform measurement system for waste electrical and electronic equipment (e-waste or WEEE). However, there is already substantial data available for both developed and less-developed countries that relate to e-waste statistics. In order to improve comparability between countries, a sound measurement framework is proposed that integrates available statistical data and non-statistical data sources into e-waste statistics. The framework captures the most important elements of e-waste and is relevant to all countries that aim to gather data and compile statistics on e-waste. Finally, indicators can be constructed from the framework, which provide a useful overview of the size of the market for electronic and electrical products within a country, as well as its e-waste generated and e-waste collection performance, and serve as a resource for policymaking. The concepts of the measurement framework have been followed by the EU and have resulted in the official adoption of the common methodology to track the collection and recycling target for article 7 in the EU WEEE Directive. Next to that, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) have used the measurement framework in pilots to gather data on e-waste globally. The methods have been applied successfully for the first Global E-waste Monitor published by the United Nations University, the second Global E-waste Monitor published by the Global E-waste Statistics Partnership, and two regional e-waste monitors co-authored by the United Nations University.1 This measurement framework is presented along with a classification of e-waste. Though the classification is, at this stage, stand-alone, it links to multiple data sources and data formats, such as the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) and the EU WEEE Directive reporting. Relevant data for the construction of the indicators might be already available in the countries' databases. The guidelines also give methods, country examples, and information to an open source script that helps countries to make their own estimates if no data is available. In addition to the full measuring framework, minimum requirements are proposed to collect and report on e-waste statistics for countries that are embarking on this type of data gathering for the first time.},

It has been observed from the literature that there are studies available comparing two or three country's waste electrical and electronic equipment status, while the study encompassing the BRICS nations considering in a single framework is scant. The purpose of this study is to analyse the existing waste electrical and electronic equipment management systems and status of compliance to Basel convention in the BRICS nations, noting possible lessons from matured systems, such as those in the European Union EU) and USA. The study introduced a novel framework for a waste electrical and electronic equipment management system that may be adopted in BRICS nations and revealed that BRICS countries have many similar types of challenges. The study also identified some significant gaps with respect to the management systems and trans-boundary movement of waste electrical and electronic equipment, which may attract researchers for further research.},

  abstract = {E-waste is a more than \$7 billion industry. Trans-border shipments of e-waste occur in international circuits, typically originating in the United States and Europe, but now also from China, and connect to accumulation sites in particular networked cities in Africa and elsewhere. Debates about the material and environmental weight associated with uncontrolled dumping are now emerging in Africa. We diverge from those debates by concentrating on the economic footprint of e-waste in a Ghanaian context by studying the largest and most prominent e-waste market—Agbogbloshie. This Accra site has achieved notoriety in the global media and among nongovernmental organizations (NGOS), but has received little research and policy attention. In an attempt to remedy this deficiency, a preliminary mapping of e-waste flows of second-hand computers into Ghana is presented. We then map the spatial organization of the e-waste hub and assess meshworks of e-waste activities, elucidating worlds of informal work. This research involved site reconnaissance, 80 questionnaires, and 40 interviews with key stakeholders. Our key finding is that e-waste activities connect Agbogbloshie directly and indirectly to various international circuits, and, most important, thereby articulates a market within a wider urban space-economy. The emphasis is on the intersections of various e-waste conduits as well as shared space within urban informal-formal circuitry.},

It is argued that the tendency to associate ‘informal' with ‘unstructured' and ‘chaotic' must end. Such an association is conceptually unsound and has led to policy disasters as the state sought to provide ‘structures' where none was presumed to exist before. Instead, the terminology of informal-formal can be used to characterize a continuum of the reach of official intervention in different economic activities, especially since official statistics already use variants of such a criterion. However, it is emphasized that ‘more' or ‘less' reach is not necessarily ‘better' or ‘worse'.},

Objectives We compared the BLLs in children living in the e-waste recycling town of Guiyu with those living in the neighboring town of Chendian. Methods We observed the processing of e-waste recycling in Guiyu and studied BLLs in a cluster sample of 226 children {$<$} 6 years of age who lived in Guiyu and Chendian. BLLs were determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Hemoglobin (Hgb) and physical indexes (height and weight, head and chest circumferences) were also measured. Results BLLs in 165 children of Guiyu ranged from 4.40 to 32.67 μg/dL with a mean of 15.3 μg/dL, whereas BLLs in 61 children of Chendian were from 4.09 to 23.10 μg/dL with a mean of 9.94 μg/dL. Statistical analyses showed that children living in Guiyu had significantly higher BLLs compared with those living in Chendian (p {$<$} 0.01). Of children in Guiyu, 81.8\% (135 of 165) had BLLs {$>$} 10 μg/dL, compared with 37.7\% of children (23 of 61) in Chendian (p {$<$} 0.01). In addition, we observed a significant increasing trend in BLLs with increasing age in Guiyu (p {$<$} 0.01). It appeared that there was correlation between the BLLs in children and numbers of e-waste workshops. However, no significant difference in Hgb level or physical indexes was found between the two towns. Conclusions The primitive e-waste recycling activities may contribute to the elevated BLLs in children living in Guiyu.},

  abstract = {E-waste (also known as waste electrical and electronic equipment) is one of the fastest-growing waste streams worldwide. Given this rapid growth, issues related to e-waste are a serious concern. Increasing amounts of e-waste pose detrimental effects to the environment and public health through improper recycling and disposal techniques. Such informal recycling practices are common in several developing countries, where recycling methods are rudimentary, and a significant proportion of e-waste components ends up in unsanitary (uncontrolled) landfill and open dump sites. To address these issues, this paper aims to introduce a systematic approach to e-waste management; a process termed integrated e-waste management (IEWM) is a theoretically viable technique in which municipal solid waste and e-waste management systems are managed. This is possible because both systems share common waste fractions and treatment and disposal technologies. Therefore, integrated e-waste management represents an advance in the controlled disposal of e-waste and improvements in local environments and public health in developing countries. This study employs a systematic approach that combines field trip work, systematic literature review, and quantitative data analysis to propose a solution that can bring benefits in the short, medium and long-term. The study proposes the hypothesis that an integrated approach can improve e-waste handling in developing countries by addressing region-specific issues simultaneously. This study considers the technical aspects of implementing an integrated approach and, by comparing these aspects against more traditional, widely practiced approaches.},

An exhaustive survey of literature was made on the latest technological approaches in noble and base metals recovery from waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) of electrical and electronic equipment. An emphasis was given to review the most important features of existing industrial routes associated with the metal recovery systems from PCBs. The discussions of green technologies as alternatives of conventional approaches to obtain precious metals from e-waste were overviewed. The application of microbial bioleaching approaches in the extraction metals from e-waste was highlighted. Finally, the concern for the challenges and barriers associated with the e-waste management process in Bangladesh was outlined.},

@article{jbaraExploringCausalityPollution,
  title = {Exploring the {{Causality}} between the {{Pollution Haven Hypothesis}} and the {{Environmental Kuznets Curve}}},
  author = {Jbara, Brian W},
  abstract = {In recent years, increased economic development, globalization, and liberalization of international trade have been linked by economists and environmental scholars as possible causes for specific trends in pollution. One of the most studied and controversial hypotheses is the Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis (EKC), which states that a country's pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a certain point, after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations again. If true, plotting pollution concentrations against income per capita will yield an inverted V-the EKe. Another controversy is the manner in which the more affluent countries reduce their pollution concentrations. Two possibilities are likely: One is that the more developed countries adopt cleaner technologies to produce their goods. The other less hopeful possibility is that developed countries simply specialize more and more in the production of products of cleaner industries, while the less affluent or developing countries take over production of products from dirtier industries. This suggests that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries. This is the essence of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH). This paper looks for evidence of an EKC across 36 countries over time. It also looks for evidence as to whether these changes over time are consistent with the PHH. Sulfur Dioxide (S02) is used as a measure of pollution concentrations for the EKC, while five dirty manufacturing industries are used to measure the level of dirty trade in developed and developing countries. Linear regression models and descriptive statistics are utilized. Overall, there is very little evidence to suggest that an EKC exists. There is no evidence to support the PHH.},

  abstract = {The distribution patterns of the particulate matter (PM) and the associated elements were investigated from Seoul, Korea during spring 2001. The results of our measurements were analyzed to explain the behavior of metallic components by comparing their compositions mainly in terms of between Asian Dust (AD) and non-AD (NAD) period and between fine and coarse particle fraction. The computation of enrichment factor (EF) indicated that the magnitude of EF values for most hazardous metals during the AD period were even smaller than the NAD counterpart. The existence of low EF values during the AD period may be ascribable to the excessive input of crustal components like Al accompanied by the AD event. In accordance with this finding, the effects of the AD events were also reflected in diverse manners, when assessed by the concentration ratios of a given element for both AD/NAD period and fine-to-coarse (F/C) fraction. Results of this comparative analysis generally suggest that AD events are prominent sources for major crustal components in the fine particle fraction of PM. In addition, comparison of our measurement data with those obtained within the Korean peninsula and in the near-by Asian areas indicates that the metallic distribution patterns of the study area may be affected more sensitively by anthropogenic signatures. The results of our analysis, if investigated in relation with air mass movement patterns by means of the back-trajectory analysis, demonstrate consistently that the PM data measured during the study period can be closely tied with the signatures of both AD events and anthropogenic processes.},

In Canada, where efforts have led to more harmonised EPR programs, one province (Québec) has introduced regulatory measures beyond those adopted elsewhere in the country. We investigate the causes for this different approach, and stakeholder interests and interactions that influenced EPR design and implementation, in Québec. We also discuss how various actors have been affected by, and have responded to, Québec's EPR program, and provide an update on how it has fared since coming into force in 2011. We conclude with some questions for further research. Québec's regulation demonstrates a greater demand for and supply of support for maintaining local employment through refurbishing and reuse, and reducing the environmental impacts of products through modulated fees, both due to the regulator's ideology and interest, and vocal stakeholders on the demand side. The Québec case shows that jurisdictions in which local firms and employment are least affected by regulation may be the most likely to experiment with novel policy instruments. At the same time, the fact that many provisions in the regulation are facing hurdles, five years after coming into force, demonstrates the hard realities of policy making and implementation, beyond the mere passing of legislation.},

In many OECD countries, where adequate policies and processing technologies exist, those who manage extended producer responsibility programs claim performance challenges due to competition from various actors collecting and managing e-waste “under the radar”. While the material and economic losses attributed to such informal activities have been estimated by previous research, a detailed understanding of who is involved in these activities, why and how they operate, and with what social and environmental impacts, is often lacking. Our research offers an in-depth investigation into Montréal's informal e-waste flows. Whereas e-waste research and advocacy posit a dichotomy between “formal” and “informal” e-waste flows, our research reveals a more nuanced situation, with no water-tight separation between these flows. Formal and informal flows are often blurred, and change over time; and many actors are involved in both formal and informal activities. We reveal mechanisms whereby actors inadvertently contribute to informal activities because of inadequate incentives, limited program scope, reuse, parts harvesting, and documentation issues. This nuanced understanding helps identify policy loopholes, program shortcomings, and strategies for more sustainable e-waste flows, taking account of more ambitious circularity objectives and a just transition.},

  abstract = {The disposal, recycling, and part salvaging of discarded electronic devices such as computers, printers, televisions, and toys are now creating a new set of waste problems. This study is aimed at identifying the sources and quantifying the pollution levels generated from electronic waste (e-waste) activities at Guiyu, Guangdong Province, China, and their potential impacts on the environment and human health. The preliminary results indicate that total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil obtained from a printer roller dump site was 593\,µg/kg dry weight (dry wt.) and in sediment from a duck pond, the PAH concentration was 514\,µg/kg (dry wt.). Sediment from the Lianjiang River was found to be contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (743\,µg/kg) at a level approaching three times the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines probable effect level of 277\,µg/kg. Total mono- to hepta-brominated diphenyl ether homologue concentrations (1140 and 1169\,µg/kg dry wt.) in soils near dumping sites were approximately 10-60 times those reported for other polybrominated diphenyl ether-contaminated locations in the world. In-house study on the open burning of cable wires showed extremely high levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans resulting in 12419\,ng toxic equivalents (TEQ)/kg of waste input and 15\,610\,ng TEQ/kg for two separate tests, respectively, which were about three orders of magnitude higher than those for the open burning of household waste. High levels of Cu (712, 528, and 496\,mg/kg), exceeding the new Dutch list action value, were determined for soil near the printer roller dumping area, sediment from Lianjiang River, and soil from a plastic burn site, respectively. A more thorough study is underway to elucidate the extent of contamination of toxic pollutants in different ecological compartments to establish whether these pollutants are bioaccumulated and biomagnified through food chains. Assessments of human health impacts from oral intake, inhalation, and dermal contact will be subsequently investigated.},

  abstract = {The recycling of printed circuit boards in Guiyu, China, a village intensely involved in e-waste processing, may present a significant environmental and human health risk. To evaluate the extent of heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) contamination from printed circuit board recycling, surface dust samples were collected from recycling workshops, adjacent roads, a schoolyard, and an outdoor food market. ICP-OES analyses revealed elevated mean concentrations in workshop dust (Pb 110\,000, Cu 8360, Zn 4420, and Ni 1500 mg/kg) and in dust of adjacent roads (Pb 22\,600, Cu 6170, Zn 2370, and Ni 304 mg/kg). Lead and Cu in road dust were 330 and 106, and 371 and 155 times higher, respectively, than non e-waste sites located 8 and 30 km away. Levels at the schoolyard and food market showed that public places were adversely impacted. Risk assessment predicted that Pb and Cu originating from circuit board recycling have the potential to pose serious health risks to workers and local residents of Guiyu, especially children, and warrants an urgent investigation into heavy metal related health impacts. The potential environmental and human health consequences due to uncontrolled e-waste recycling in Guiyu serves as a case study for other countries involved in similar crude recycling activities.},

  abstract = {Background. Recycling of electronic waste (e-waste) in developing nations poses a risk to the environment and human health through the release of heavy metals. Objectives. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of heavy metals in Douala, Cameroun, the site of e-waste recycling activities. Methods. Soil samples were collected from Makea, Ngodi and New Bell e-waste recycling sites, as well as from a control site. Samples were digested and levels of heavy metals were determined. Results. The concentrations of the heavy metals in Makea occurred in the order of lead (Pb) (290±40) {$>$} zinc (Zn) (160±30) {$>$} chromium (Cr) (130±40) {$>$} copper (Cu) (130±20) {$>$} nickel (Ni) (56±5.7) {$>$} cadmium (Cd) (20±3.0); Pb (310±30) {$>$}Zn (150±20) {$>$}Cu (80±30) {$>$}Cr (70±40) {$>$}Ni (50±1.0) {$>$}Cd (30±5.0) in Ngodi; and Pb (280±40) {$>$}Zn (155±35) {$>$}Cu (80±50) {$>$}Cr (70±40) {$>$}Ni (53±2.0) {$>$}Cd (20±10) in New Bell. The levels of metals in all of the samples were higher compared to the control site, which was composed of vegetation and far from the e-waste sites, and in some cases, higher than permissible limits or guidelines. The ecological risk index of heavy metals for soil samples in all the e-waste sites indicated a very high risk. Conclusions. Heavy metals concentrations in soil around e-waste recycling sites present serious health risks and further investigations are needed. Competing Interests. The authors declare no competing financial interests.},

In response, state legislatures across the country are considering bills that would require firms to share replacement parts, tools, software updates, and documentation with independent repair shops and consumers. Beyond those legislative proposals, the battle over repair extends to courts, administrative agencies, and even presidential campaigns. As a matter of both policy and legal doctrine, that debate must be informed by consumer attitudes and expectations. Do consumers prefer the convenience and simplicity of replacing their devices when something goes wrong? Or do they expect and value the ability to repair the things they own? If repair restrictions interfere with such expectations and prevent consumers from engaging in lawful repairs, the case for intervention is more persuasive. This Article presents the results of a nationwide survey of consumers of electronic devices and explores its implications for the burgeoning right to repair movement.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the findings of national e-waste assessments prepared in West Africa, which were developed under the framework of the Basel Convention "e-waste Africa project". West Africa faces a rising tide of e-waste generated by domestic consumption of new and used electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). In the five countries studied, between 650,000 and 1,000,000 tons of domestic e-waste are generated each year, which need to be managed to protect human health and the environment in the region. Aside from domestic consumption, the e-waste problem is exacerbated by an on-going stream of used EEE from industrialized countries. Although the majority of this imported equipment is destined for re-use after testing and repair, there are significant volumes that prove unsuitable for re-use and further add to local e-waste generation. Study results suggest that West Africa serves as the major trading route of used EEE into the African continent, with Ghana and Nigeria as the main import hubs.},

As more people have greater access to more electronic devices, we must inquire about the eventual fate of these devices. E-waste is frequently sent to locales without ready access to formal e-waste recycling technologies and techniques. Workers there crudely dismantle and dissolve electronic parts for valuable materials. This often comes at a health and ecological cost. Wealthier regions can process e-waste more safely, but even so, safety measures may not be evenly applied. This is an overview of many topics: global e-waste flows and Canadas place in them, the dangers of improper e-waste recycling, why communities in the Global South may welcome e-waste processing despite these dangers, the emergence of global e-waste recycling hubs, what's being done about e-waste in Canada, and a proposal for an improved model of recycling.},

  abstract = {With the increasing global legal and illegal trade of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) comes an equally increasing concern that poor WEEE recycling techniques, particularly in developing countries, are generating more and more environmental pollution that affects both ecosystems and the people living within or near the main recycling areas. This review presents data found in the scientific and grey literature about concentrations of lead (Pb), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated dioxins and furans as well as polybrominated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) monitored in various environmental compartments in China and India, two countries where informal WEEE recycling plays an important economic role. The data are compared with known concentration thresholds and other pollution level standards to provide an indication of the seriousness of the pollution levels in the study sites selected and further to indicate the potential negative impact of these pollutants on the ecosystems and humans affected. The review highlights very high levels of Pb, PBDEs, PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs in air, bottom ash, dust, soil, water and sediments in WEEE recycling areas of the two countries. The concentration levels found sometimes exceed the reference values for the sites under investigation and pollution observed in other industrial or urban areas by several orders of magnitude. These observations suggest a serious environmental and human health threat, which is backed up by other studies that have examined the impact of concentrations of these compounds in humans and other organisms. The risk to the population treating WEEE and to the surrounding environment increases with the lack of health and safety guidelines and improper recycling techniques such as dumping, dismantling, inappropriate shredding, burning and acid leaching. At a regional scale, the influence of pollutants generated by WEEE recycling sites is important due to the long-distance transport potential of some chemicals. Although the data presented are alarming, the situation could be improved relatively rapidly by the implementation of more benign recycling techniques and the development and enforcement of WEEE-related legislation at the national level, including prevention of unregulated WEEE exports from industrialised countries.},

The Households and the Environment Survey: Energy Use (HEUS) is a follow up on the Households and the Environment survey. The goal of the survey is to obtain permission from householders to collect information on their energy consumption from their energy provider(s). The Households and the Environment Survey: Energy Use phase 3 (HEUS phase 3) is a follow up on the Households and the Environment survey (HES phase 1) and on the Households and the Environment Survey: Energy Use phase 2 (HEUS phase 2). During HEUS phase 3, the energy providers are contacted in order to obtain the energy consumption data for the respondents who filled the consent form in HEUS phase 2. Together, the 3 phases of this survey were designed to collect data to develop and improve three key environmental indicators: air quality, water quality and greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {Discarded electronic goods contain a range of toxic materials requiring special handling. Developed countries have conventions, directives, and laws to regulate their disposal, most based on extended producer responsibility. Manufacturers take back items collected by retailers and local governments for safe destruction or recovery of materials. Compliance, however, is difficult to assure, and frequently runs against economic incentives. The expense of proper disposal leads to the shipment of large amounts of e-waste to China, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, and other developing countries. Shipment is often through middlemen, and under tariff classifications that make quantities difficult to assess. There, despite the intents of national regulations and hazardous waste laws, most e-waste is treated as general refuse, or crudely processed, often by burning or acid baths, with recovery of only a few materials of value. As dioxins, furans, and heavy metals are released, harm to the environment, workers, and area residents is inevitable. The faster growth of e-waste generated in the developing than in the developed world presages continued expansion of a pervasive and inexpensive informal processing sector, efficient in its own way, but inherently hazard-ridden.},

E-waste recycling, which often includes burning and burial of used, discarded, and scavenged equipment, profoundly affects the soil, water, and air quality of these industrial sites, as well as landscapes farther afield. The globally influenced dumping operations and the informal recycling methods employed to extract valuable raw materials raise questions of environmental ethics, social justice, and appropriate land use. At issue is the balance between the externalities of e-waste and the economic needs of Nigeria, attitudes about the earth as a repository for e-waste, and the subsequent implications for Nigeria's economic, ecological, and human health.},

  abstract = {The Bamako Convention is a treaty of African nations prohibiting the import into Africa of any hazardous (including radioactive) waste. The convention came into force in 1998. Treaty text Decisions from the First Conference of Parties Origin The Bamako convention is a response to Article 11 of the Basel convention which encourages parties to enter into bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements on Hazardous Waste to help achieve the objectives of the convention. The impetus for the Bamako convention arose also from: The failure of the Basel Convention to prohibit trade of hazardous waste to less developed countries (LDCs); The realization that many developed nations were exporting toxic wastes to Africa (Koko case in Nigeria, Probo Koala case in Ivory Coast). Specificity The Bamako convention uses a format and language similar to that of the Basel convention, except that: (a) it is much stronger in prohibiting all imports of hazardous waste, and (b) it does not make exceptions on certain hazardous wastes (like those for radioactive materials) made by the Basel convention. Status of the Convention It was negotiated by 12 nations of the African Union (former Organization of African Unity) at Bamako, Mali in January, 1991. I t came into force in 1998. To date, it has 29 Signatories and 25 Parties Purpose of the Convention To prohibit the import of all hazardous and radioactive wastes into the African continent for any reason; To minimize and control transboundary movements of hazardous wastes within the African continent. To prohibit all ocean and inland water dumping or incineration of hazardous wastes. To ensure that disposal of wastes is conducted in an “environmentally sound manner". To promote cleaner production over the pursuit of a permissible emissions approach based on assimilative capacity assumptions To establish the precautionary principle. What does the Convention cover? The Convention covers more wastes than covered by the Basel Convention as it not only includes radioactive wastes but also considers any waste with a listed hazardous characteristic or a listed constituent as a hazardous waste; the Convention also covers national definitions of hazardous waste. Other products also covered under the Convention as waste include that have been severely restricted or have been subject of prohibitions. General obligations Countries should ban the import of hazardous and radioactive wastes as well as all forms of ocean disposal. For Intra-African waste trade, parties must minimize the trans-boundary movement of wastes and only conduct it with consent of the importing and transit states among other controls; they should minimize the production of hazardous wastes and cooperate to ensure that wastes are treated and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.

The NASN had 16 sampling stations, Nopporo, Sapporo, Nonotake, Sendai, Niigata, Tokyo, Kawasaki, Nagoya, Kyoto-Hachiman, Osaka, Amagasaki, Kurashiki, Matsue, Ube, Chikugo-Ogori and Ohmuta in Japan, at which aerosols were regularly collected every month and samples collected by low volume air sampler were analyzed by neutron activation analysis (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Results of trend analysis showed that the annual average concentrations of crustal and anthropogenic elements decreased significantly between 1974 and 1996. Furthermore, the concentrations of selected crustal and anthropogenic elements were higher between 1974 and 1979 than between 1980 and 1989. Crustal elements displayed high concentrations in the “Kosa” period (the dust season from March to May) and in winter (November and December) and low concentrations in summer (July and August). The ratios of elemental average concentrations in the Kosa period to those of summer were 2-5 times higher and those of winter relative to those of summer were 1.5-3 times higher for crustally derived elements. Particularly, concentration of Sc in Matsue was 8 times higher during the Kosa period than during summer time. Some of anthropogenic elements also showed high concentrations in the Kosa Season and low concentrations in summer. The ratios of elemental concentration in the Kosa period to those of summer and those of winter relative to summer were 2-4 times higher for some anthropogenically derived elements. Especially, the concentration of Zn in Chikugo-Ogori was 5.7 times higher during wintertime than during summertime.},

  abstract = {Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) encompasses a great variety of products. The heterogeneous characteristics and lack of standardized classification create substantial difficulties to compare take-back and recycling performance. This paper proposes a systematic classification of WEEE, enabling improved scope definition and better comparability of performance results. It is organized based on three essential perspectives: product type, waste management and legislative relevancy. The proposed classification list is divided into 58 categories by linking all possible WEEE items (about 900 product types) and various conventional categorizations. Additionally, an important source facilitating the categorization is the international goods codes systems. By aligning with the classifications applied in trade statistics, custom authorities and national statistical offices, this categorization enables consistent comparison of performance between regions and compliance schemes. The approach developed is an important reference for an independent check of the registered EEE amounts put on the market and WEEE generated. As such this forms a relevant input for the upcoming WEEE recast collection target definition in Europe. A case study is conducted in the Netherlands for a system mapping of the national e-waste flows in 2011, and average weight for each category is provided.},

  abstract = {The recycling of e-waste by the informal sector has brought countries in the Global South raw materials (e.g. metals and plastics), second-hand electronic equipment and components, and economic opportunities in conjunction with appalling environmental pollutions and health problems. Despite the longstanding international and national legislation regulating transnational trade and domestic recycling, informal e-waste economies are still clustering in many Global South countries. This study offers historically and geographically specific explanations of this conundrum, by interrogating the multi-scalar regulatory frameworks in which the informal e-waste economies and their pollutions are embedded, by drawing on China, particularly the former global e-waste hub-Guiyu town, as the case study. We argue that the contested and problematic application of current international and national legislation in regulating e-waste is in part pertaining to the slippery definition of what counts as “e-waste” and its paradoxical nature as both resources and pollutants. At the global scale, trajectories of global e-waste flows are shaped by the multitude of loopholes, contradictions and ambiguous articles left by the Basel Convention and by different countries' disparate attitudes towards the e-waste trade. At the national scale, the ambiguities and contradictions in the Basel Convention have been passed on to and shaped China's national e-waste regulatory frameworks. China's equivocal legislation, paradoxical attitude, and formal enterprises' weak competence contribute to the rise of informal e-waste recycling in Guiyu. Yet, China's e-waste regime has been greatly restructured within the past decade, with formal recycling enterprises playing an increasingly significant role.},

This paper conducts an exploratory analysis about the e-waste management at different scales (economic blocs and country levels) in the American continent, emphasizing generation patterns, e-waste fluxes and the regulation frameworks in Brazil and Canada in order to identify how the e-waste management options are driven by specific legal, economic, and environmental criteria. The methodology includes a review of literature covering information and indicators for both quantitative and qualitative analysis and comparison between selected countries regarding positive and negative aspects of e-waste management systems in each jurisdiction. The finds suggest that although Brazil and Canada have differentiated scope of regulation, both ratified the Basel Convention, have an action agenda that seeks to prioritize the management of hazardous substances, as well as lack of harmonized regulation, low control of the e-waste illegal trade and traceability. The identification of e-waste flows and comparison of economic blocs and countries is a still little explored theme and emphasizes the need for adequate legal measures to implement circular economy strategies to avoid impacts and enhance the value recovery of these materials in the production chain. Doing so could support harmonized regulation, new business models and increase sustainability levels for citizens through solutions that integrate policies and practices between and within economic blocs.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA damage occurs in heavy metal exposure, but the simultaneous effect on DNA repair is unknown. We investigated the influence of co-exposure of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) on 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and human repair enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) mRNA levels in exposed children to evaluate the imbalance of DNA damage and repair. Children within the age range of 3-6~years from a primitive electronic waste (e-waste) recycling town were chosen as participants to represent a heavy metal-exposed population. 8-OHdG in the children's urine was assessed for heavy metal-induced oxidative effects, and the hOGG1 mRNA level in their blood represented the DNA repair ability of the children. Among the children surveyed, 88.14\% (104/118) had a blood Pb level {$>$}5~μg/dL, 22.03\% (26/118) had a blood Cd level {$>$}1~μg/dL, and 62.11\% (59/95) had a blood Hg level {$>$}10~μg/dL. Having an e-waste workshop near the house was a risk factor contributing to high blood Pb (rs~=~0.273, p~{$<~$}0.01), while Cd and Hg exposure could have come from other contaminant sources. Preschool children of fathers who had a college or university education had significantly lower 8-OHdG levels (median 242.76~ng/g creatinine, range 154.62-407.79~ng/g creatinine) than did children of fathers who had less education (p~=~0.035). However, we did not observe a significant difference in the mRNA expression levels of hOGG1 between the different variables. Compared with children having low lead exposure (quartile 1), the children with high Pb exposure (quartiles 2, 3, and 4) had significantly higher 8-OHdG levels (βQ2~=~0.362, 95\% CI 0.111-0.542; βQ3~=~0.347, 95\% CI 0.103-0.531; βQ4~=~0.314, 95\% CI 0.087-0.557). Associations between blood Hg levels and 8-OHdG were less apparent. Compared with low levels of blood Hg (quartile 1), elevated blood Hg levels (quartile 2) were associated with higher 8-OHdG levels (βQ2~=~0.236, 95\% CI 0.039-0.406). Compared with children having low lead exposure (quartile 1), the children with high Pb exposure (quartiles 2, 3, and 4) had significantly higher 8-OHdG levels.},

  abstract = {Prenatal exposure to lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) has been associated with a series of physiological problems resulting in fetal growth restriction. We aimed to investigate the effects of Pb and Cd exposure on placental function and the potential mechanisms involved in fetal development. Placental specimens and questionnaires were collected from an e-waste area and a reference area in China. Two-dimensional electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF-MS/MS and molecular network relationship were performed to analyze differentially expressed proteins using a compositing sample pool. Compared with the reference group, the exposed group exhibited significantly higher levels of placental Pb and Cd (p{$<$}0.01), shorter body length and higher gestational age (p{$<$}0.01). After bivariate adjustment in a linear regression model, decreases of 205.05g in weight and 0.44cm in body length were associated with a 10ng/g wt increase in placental Cd. Pb showed a negative trend but lacked statistical significance. Proteomic analysis showed 32 differentially-expressed proteins and were predominantly involved in protein translocation, cytoskeletal structure, and energy metabolism. Fumarate hydratase was down-regulated in the exposed placenta tissues and validated by ELISA. Alterations in placental proteome suggest that imbalances in placental mitochondria respiration might be a vital pathway targeting fetal growth restriction induced by exposure to Cd.},
